### Exploring US Bikeshare Data with Python

### Description

This project uses Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States-Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The data was collected by Motivate, a bike share company that operates bike share systems in over 50 cities around the world.


### Files used

* [bikeshare.py](https://github.com/Sunday-Gad/pdsnd_github/blob/master/bikeshare_2.py) : This is the main Python script that imports the data, answers interesting questions about it, and creates an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

* chicago.csv : This file contains bike share data for Chicago.

* new_york_city.csv : This file contains bike share data for New York City.

* washington.csv: This file contains bike share data for Washington.

### Requirement
This program was written in Python (version 3.11.5) and relies on the following libraries:
* pandas python library
* numpy python library


### Usage

To run the project, you will need to have Python installed. Once you have Python installed, you can run the project by opening a terminal window and navigating to the directory where the project files are located. Then, you can run the following command:

`python bikeshare.py`

This will start the interactive experience in the terminal. You can then enter your questions about the data and the script will answer them.
